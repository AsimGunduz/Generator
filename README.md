## Installation

## Basic Usage

## Road Map


## Motivation & Intention
I've been using both Telerik and Mudblazor components in my projects. Telerik components offer a lot of functions, but the UI is ugly. Mudblazor gives a beautiful user interface, but it lacks functionality when compared to Telerik components and needs more work when implementing components such as Tables and SelectInput
while Telerik Grid is simple to use and takes care of everything.

All this inspired me to create Gen Components using Mudblazor components to resemble Telerik Grid.
